I have been working on a new project that combines knot theory with music.

## The Concept
We are looking for a way to visualize the "interface" between geometric forms and organic forms.

## The Code
Here is a snippet of the Wolfram Language[^1] code I am using:

```
Table[Style[k, Hue[k/20]], {k, 1, 20}]
```

[^1]: Hey wait I can make a footnote!

    And if I want the footnote to be multiple lines I can do that too.

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C --> D[Result one]
  C --> E[Result two]
```

## The Math

The core of the structure relies on the flow polytope equation:

$$\mathcal{F}_G = \left\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^E : \sum_{e \in \text{in}(v)} x_e = \sum_{e \in \text{out}(v)} x_e \right\}$$
