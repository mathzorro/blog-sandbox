## Welcome!

Welcome to hanusa.xyz. This is the webpage of Christopher R. H. Hanusa, professor of mathematics at [Queens College](https://www.qc.cuny.edu) of the City University of New York.

In 2025, Queens College decided to transition all its webpages away from college infrastructure. So I set up hanusa.xyz to be my index.html away from home. I thought that xyz would be suitable since it evokes the $(x,y,z)$ coordinate system, my mathematical research is in the combinatorics of high dimensional geometry, and the [mathematical art](https://christopherhanusa.com) and [mathematical jewelry](https://hanusadesign.com) that I design is designed in the computer and made physical through a 3D printing process.

## The Vision

In late 2025 and early 2026, I've taken the time to redevelop the site to be more reflective of the breadth of the work that I do in my job, and allow for updating the website through a blog interface, as you're reading right now. I've gained skills in conveying ideas through regular updates as I took on my role as the Faculty Liaison for Evaluation and Assessment and built communication infrastructure to keep the campus informed about the accreditation process.

My goal in writing is to provide additional context for the work that I do as a professor, to increase transparency about all the facets of the job, and share the good work that happens amongst my collaborators and colleagues.

## Coding the Site

The site is hosted on Github Pages, and was developed with the help of Google Gemini. 

The blog feature is built using Quarto, which allows for built in $\LaTeX$ code: $$\sum_{i=1}^\infty \textup{Wow}_i!.$$

:::{.callout-note}
Quarto has a lot of built in features, including these callouts!
