# New Year, New Site

Welcome to the new hanusa.xyz. In 2025, Queens College transitioned all its webpages away from the college infrastructure. So I set up hanusa.xyz to be my index.html away from home. 
I've taken the time to redevelop the site to be more reflective of the breadth of the work that I do in my job.

## The Vision

## Coding the Site
The site is hosted on Github Pages, and was developed with the help of Google Gemini. 

Furthermore, the blog feature is built on Quarto, which allows for built in $\LaTeX$ code $$\sum_{i=1}^\infty \textup{Wow_i!}.$$

:::{.callout-note}
Quarto has a lot of built in features, including these callouts!
