I’ve gained skills in conveying ideas through regular updates as I took on my role as the Faculty Liaison for Evaluation and Assessment and built communication infrastructure to keep the campus informed about the accreditation process.\nMy goal in writing is to provide additional context for the work that I do as a professor, to increase transparency about all the facets of the job, and share the good work that happens amongst my collaborators and colleagues."
